        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Should I Go Gluten-Free?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Only if you have celiac disease, when gluten (a protein in grains) damages your small intestine. Experts no longer think gluten causes rashes, stomachaches, or weight gain in people without the disease. It can’t hurt to skip gluten-rich foods like cookies and white bread. But don’t ditch whole grains unless your doctor says to. They fill you up and are full of healthy nutrients.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Is a Daily Glass of Wine Healthy?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Not for everyone. Small amounts of alcohol may stave off heart disease, and lower the odds of stroke and diabetes, too. But heavy drinking ups your chances for liver and heart damage, plus breast, colon, and other cancers. If you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit yourself to one drink a day if you’re a woman, or two if you’re a man.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Are Short Workouts Worth It?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes. Longer is better, but you can get by with quick bouts of activity when that’s all you have time for. The CDC suggests 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week (like walking or biking at a medium-fast pace), plus two sessions of muscle-strengthening exercise. Several 10- minute bursts of exercise each day can get you to this goal and help keep you fit.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Does Cholesterol in Food Count?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Obesity, inactivity, and a poor diet can do more to raise your cholesterol than an egg. The real bad guys are the unhealthy trans fats and saturated fats found in meats, dairy, and processed foods. Opt for low-fat dairy and lean meats, read labels, and watch your carbs and portions. If your numbers are high, ask your doctor what foods you should avoid.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Do Vaccines Cause Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          No. A 1998 study that claimed Autism Spectrum Disorder was caused by the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was based on faulty research and was later retracted. Meanwhile, several other more recent studies show vaccines have no connection at all to autism -- but they do lower kids’ risks of getting dangerous health conditions like whooping cough and polio.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Is Microwaved Food Unsafe?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Reheat those leftovers. Microwaves don’t make food “radioactive.” All your microwave does is make the water molecules in food move, which creates friction that heats it up. Microwaves do create a small magnetic field but a lot of work goes into making sure there’s not enough to cause problems. Just don’t use one with a damaged door.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Do Cell Phones Cause Brain Cancer?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          It’s unlikely. Most research -- including a study of more than 420,000 people over 20 years -- says there’s no connection between brain tumors and cell phone use.  A more recent study, though, found a link between a specific type of brain tumor called a glioma and heavy cell phone use. If you’re worried, wear a headset, use the speaker, and limit your phone time.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Can I Be Fat and Healthy?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Experts aren’t sure. One study said heavier people may outlive lighter folks, but most research shows that those who carry extra pounds are more likely to get heart disease, cancer or die before thinner folks. Your best bet: Do what you can to get healthy. Stay active every day and eat a balanced diet. Lose some weight if you need to.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp  What causes kidney stones?</h3> 
        <div class="answer">
          Being told that you have “stones” may be good as long as the stones are metaphorical, meaning guts or a backbone. Being told that you have kidney stones, not so good. Kidney stones, otherwise known as renal lithiasis or nephrolithiasis if you want words harder to pronounce, form when some type of mineral or salt clusters together inside your kidneys. Stones can form when you have too much of certain mineral or salt or if you are not hydrated enough. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones can form when you get high doses of vitamin D, undergo bypass surgery, or have metabolic issues. Uric acid stones can result when you eat too much protein or have gout. Certain types of urinary tract infection can lead to struvite stones.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp  What is HPV ?</h3> 
        <div class="answer">
          Well, if you look at the website abbreviations.com, HPV can stand for high production volume, human powered vehicle, high-pressure vent, having purple vomit, high pressure valve, high pitch voice, high point vent, or the Princeville Airport in Kauai, Hawaii. Assuming that 2019 did not see a surge of visitors to Kauai or people eating purple crayons, most searching for HPV probably were interested in “human papilloma virus.” This type of HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world. I have already written for Forbes about what this HPV is, after President Donald Trump apparently asked Bill Gates the difference between HPV and HIV, which is a bit like asking the difference between the CIA and a CPA.
