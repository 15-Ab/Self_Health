## Description

The main thing which i like about this creation is that it can tell you about your problems given your symptoms. Now you will say it's simply a symptom checker tool, but this website is far more than that.

Firstly we have a self-test option here, by clicking those we lands on another page which further asks to specify the body area, so here we have divided the body nomenclature into three parts, namely - upper body, middle body and the lower body, So let's say we would like to check upper body first , then we would see the options respectively forehead, eye, ears, etc. Suppose I'm experiencing some problem in my eyes so i will select the eye and click on submit, now i will be asked about my symptoms. Let's say my eyes are flowing so i will choose eye discharge here, and then set submit and on just a click i got my result, it will tell me what problems/diseases i am suffering or may suffer from. It will tabulate the possibilities according to the given symptom(s). Now i can easily look about what is this or that,  the headers of the  disease will be displayed on the screen from where i can refer my issue with, for further investigation there a link provided too, by clicking through we will get all the information about the problem.

We have a statistics section where we can find some health related stats, such as life expectancy or the mortality rate or how much is spent on health in our country. This section is regularly updated.

Next is the doctor's section, where we have our best skilled and highly professional medical practitioners. Ä°n our initial phase we have added the doctors which are in our city, as we will expand our project, then it will include other cities doctors too.

Now as everybody knows that there are some questions which are frequently asked to doctors so we have make a collection of them and put it out faqs section, here you will found the answers of the most frequently asked health related questions, like how to get rid of hiccups as we have it sometimes, so this is what faq provides.

Now as a member of modern civilization, all of us wants to be updated. So we have section on that too, we have named it as blogs, as the new and recent research studies will appear here. 


Place where you can easily select symptoms you are experiencing, and we will tell you what this can lead you to.

No need to consult doctor or go anywhere, we are providing you with all the highly professional doctors and extremely researched resources, all on your screen.
